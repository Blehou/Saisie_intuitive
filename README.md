In order to broaden the range of possible functionalities of the ‘Intuitive input’ project, you are provided with a raw text file entitled ‘words _current.txt’ containing all the words from the SMS files supplied.

Before it can be used, it must be pre-processed and converted into a format that meets the needs of your application, e.g. :

- associate a number of occurrences with each distinct word in the ‘words _current.txt’ file;

- associate the date of last use.
